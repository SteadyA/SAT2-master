Proof of Stake (PoS)
-------------------------------

- First year: 10% interest
- Second year: 5% interest
- Third year onwards: 2.5% interest
- Minimum stake age: 10 days
- Maximum stake age: 20 days
- Block target: 20 seconds

Proof of Work (PoW)
-------------------------------

- 10 SAT² per block
- Reward halving every week
- Block target: 80 seconds
- PoW gets cut off at block 21600 (which should take about 20 days)
  Note: this is only a very short PoW stage, which has a minimal impact on the total supply. The reason we need a PoW phase is because the minimum stake age is 10 days, so   no staking will occur during the initial 10 days. During that time we need PoW to keep the chain moving.
